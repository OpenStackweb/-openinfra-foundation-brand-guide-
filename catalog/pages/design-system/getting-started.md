#### **What is the OpenInfra design system?** 

The OpenInfra Design System is a set of styles, assets, and reusable components built to speed up interactive design work and improve both efficiency and consistency between visual design and development. Our Figma components correspond with coded React components which are either currently being used or will be used on [openinfra.dev](https://openinfra.dev/).


#### **How do I use the design system?** 

To use the design system, navigate to the Figma main menu, select Libraries, and activate the OpenInfra Design System.

plain: true
src: "../assets/Images/how-to-use.png"
```

You now have access to components via the Assets panel, as well as all text, color, effect, and grid styles.

```

#### **What if I don’t see the component I need?** 

The design system contains commonly used styles and design patterns, but does not define every possible combination of assets.  

It is pefectly acceptable to create single-use components comprised of styles and assets already found in the system. This will keep our system flexible and expressive while still maintaining consistency.  

If a component is being used more than once, it’s probably a good candiate for inclusion in the design system.
